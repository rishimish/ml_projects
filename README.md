# ml_projects
In this repo I will post ml-projects which I had done. 

## 1. Best_classifier -  [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/rishimish/ml_projects/best_classifier.py)

In this project i created an web app with streamlit, in which 3 famous ml datasets are used and 3 classifiers i.e KNN, SVM and random forests are used and accuracy is calculated

library used - scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, streamlit </li>

## 2. Graduate Admission Prediction Using Multiple linear Regression - [REPO-LINK](https://github.com/rishimish/University-Admission-Prediction-Using-Multiple-Linear-Regression)

In this project I trained the regression models to find the probability of a student getting accepted into a particular university based on their profile. 
The data used in following manner: <ul><li>GRE Scores ( out of 340 ) </li>
                                   <li>TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 ) </li>
                                   <li>University Rating ( out of 5 ) </li>
                                  <li>Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 ) </li>
                                   <li>Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 ) </li>
                                   <li>Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 ) </li>
                                   <li>the chance of admit (as 0 or 1)</li> </ul>
                               
library used - keras, scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas
